# Dockerized Development and Predictive Modeling for Public Health

Jupyter Notebok displaying a Pytorch regression model to predict the number of deaths for a WI census given the number of individuals who tested positive for COVID (grouped by age). For this project, regression coefficients were optimized usng PyTorch's stochastic gradient descent. 

# Development Environment

Project was desinged within a Google Cloud instance and used Docker containerization for stable development environment and consistent performance. Visual Studio Code was the primary form of connection alongside my local machine's terminal (for accessing Jupyter Notebook instance running in virtual machine).
