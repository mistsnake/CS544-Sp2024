Instructor: Dr. Meenakshi Syamkumar

## Project 1

Deployed a virtual machine through Google Cloud and installed Docker into Ubuntu Linux. Wrote a shell script to automate bash commands and bundled it within a Docker container/image.


## Project 2

Used PyTorch to create a regression model to predict deaths there will be for a WI census given the number of people who tested positive for COVID broken into age groups. PyTorch was also used to:
- multiply tensors
- check GPU availability
- optimize inputs to minimize outputs
- optimize regression coefficients using PyTorch's `torch.optim.SGD`

## Project 3

Created an LRU cache for simple arithmetic requests received over a network via gRPC calls. Implemented multithreading using Python's `threads` module and added locks to handle concurrency.
